## The Data We Collect

Our services at Abstra are divided into three main parts: Editor, Cloud, and Player.

1. Editor:
   - Modifications made to the content of the abstra.json file, excluding .py code content
   - MAC address of the user's device
   - API key (when the user is logged into our system)

2. Cloud:
   - Backend related logs that are created during program execution
   - The user's email address used for registration
   - User's application settings

3. Player:
   - Page views and interactions

## Data Access and Management

All collected data is available to you and members of your organization. When logged in, you can manage access to an organization that consolidates your applications.

Our team also has access to the collected data for operational, debugging and product improvement purposes. We make a diligent effort to limit our team members' access to the minimum data necessary.

The only exception to data access are environment variables. These elements are encrypted, and we do not access them unless explicitly requested by a member of your organization.
